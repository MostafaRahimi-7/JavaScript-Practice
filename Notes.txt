How to declare the variables:
Let, Const, Var:

let: We use let that will change the value during the execution of the programm.
For example:
let fruit = apple;
fruit = banana;

const: We use const that don't want to change the value during the execution of the programm.
Note: also we can not define a empty const variable without assign value to it.
For example:
const birthYear = 2001;
birthYear = 2000; => this is an error.
const escape; => this is an error to we have to assign a value to the const variable after the decalting.


var: avoid this keyword nowadays. because this is outdated. this a little similar with let
